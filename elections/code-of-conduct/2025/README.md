## Purpose

The role of this election is to fill out the three (3) seats open for election
this year on the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee]. Each elected
member will serve a two (2) year term.

*In an effort to deconflict between Steering and Code of Conduct Committee
election timing and provide new Steering Committee members sufficient time to
onboard (3+ months), the Steering Committee has made the decision to move the
Code of Conduct Committee elections to follow the 2024 Steering elections,
instead of preceding them.*

## Election Platform

We will be using [Elekto] to conduct the election. Elekto relies entirely on GitHub OAuth for
voting, and as such does not use email at all. Elekto also handles exceptions,
eligibility checks, and other aspects of the election. See the [Elekto voting documentation]
for how to use it.

## Eligibility

- Candidate commits to putting the interests of the community above the interests of their employer for all Code of Conduct Committee activities.
- Is generally a responsible human
- Does not have to be part of the Kubernetes or CNCF community
- Characteristics which would be nice in any nominations:
  - Previous experience on an Ethics Committee or Code of Conduct Committee is appreciated
  - Has demonstrated integrity, professionalism, and positive influence within the community is appreciated
  - Experience with the tools which we use to communicate (Zoom, Slack, GitHub, etc.) within the Kubernetes community is appreciated
