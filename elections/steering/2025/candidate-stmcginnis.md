## What I have done

I've contributed to Kubernetes since 2017, though I would characterize my
involvement as "breadth" rather than "depth" so far. Some of the various
things I have done or been involved in:

- Early on CSI and storage related discussions
- Greatly refactored the CAPI Cluster API Provider Docker (CAPD)
- Code and docs reviews
- Random "drive by" contributions where I saw opportunities to make improvements
- Maintainer on Kind and Cloud Provider Kind
- Contributor Summit organizer and volunteer
- KubeCon program committee member or track chair for many events

## What I'll do

I see the steering committee focus as the processes and policies of the
community rather than as a technical one. These decisions have a major impact
on the experience of members of the community, especially those "casual"
contributors (like I was for many years) and the likelihood they will stick
around and become more involved.

As the Kubernetes community matures, there are lessons learned from my time
in the OpenStack community as project lead for multiple projects, Technical
Committee member, and Foundation individual Board of Director member that I 
hope will be valuable for trying - and avoiding - certain things.
