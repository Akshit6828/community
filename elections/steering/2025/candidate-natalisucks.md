## SIGS

- SIG Docs / Co-Chair
- SIG Contributor Experience / Contributor Summit Team, Maintainer Summit 2025 Program Chair
- SIG Release / v1.30 Release Comms Shadow

## What I have done

I've served as the Co-chair of SIG Docs since 2022, with my Kubernetes contribution journey starting in 2020 via SIG Auth. Some highlights:
- I led the launch of the official Localization Subproject for Kubernetes, which earned me the [2021 Kubernetes Contributor Award](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2021/) for SIG Docs. Kubernetes documentation is now available in 16 different languages, and I spearheaded greater recognition of localization contributions via Kubernetes organization membership for new contributors
- I helped launch the regular issue triage sessions for SIG Auth. This triaging helped the SIG organize work on various KEPs, such as [improvements to the KMS API](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/09/kms-v2-improvements/)
- I've lead several areas for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit since 2021, and am currently Program Chair of the CNCF Manintainer Summit across EU (London) and NA (Atlanta) for 2025
- I served on the Release Team for v1.30 as a Release Comms Shadow to foster greater collaboration between my SIG and the Release Team


## What Iâ€™ll do

The Steering Committee has lacked gender diversity for many years. One of my motivations for running has been to address this issue, which means that voting for either Kat, Priyanka, Rita, or myself could unlock the ability for Steering to return to the Maintainer Track at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon and speak directly to users and new potential contributors. I believe that Kat, Priyanka, Rita, and I are all exceptional leaders who can represent Kubernetes well if we, as a community, choose to prioritize better representation of our maintainers.
As for me, I plan to continue working for the project authentically and transparently. I have served on various steering committees and understand that this is an operational role, meant to help bridge collaboration gaps that exist across ownership areas of the project. This also means triaging the whims of major cloud providers, while ensuring maintainers can still feel supported by our governance and processes. I like helping people achieve great things, and that's what I want to be doing as an elected member of Steering.
