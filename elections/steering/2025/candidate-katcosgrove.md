## What I have done

I joined the Kubernetes project in 2020, handling the fallout of the Dockershim deprecation. I authored multiple blog articles quelling community fears in the wake of the deprecation announcement and ahead of the release that finally removed Dockershim.

I joined the release team in v1.23. During the v1.28 release, I noticed a severe gap in reporting, stepped up to fill in the role so the release would not be delayed, and was awarded [SIG Release Contributor of the Year](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2023/#release) for it.

As v1.30 lead, I was the first release lead to manage the merging of CI Signal and Bug Triage into one subteam. I was the first release lead to use the [release team removal guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/release-team-removal.md), which I co-authored. I also implemented a [Docs Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#docs-freeze) phase, drastically reducing the workload for SIG Docs and Release Docs.

For my improvements to Release Docs, Release Comms, and the release process overall, I became the Release Team subproject lead and a SIG Docs tech lead, and have continued to make significant improvements to the operation of both. In my tenure, the number of subteams required to release Kubernetes has been reduced from six to four while the number of KEPs that reach the finish line has steadily increased, without increasing the workload for SIGs we collaborate with most often.

My goal has always been to improve the efficiency and operation of the Release Team and the project overall. Many of the improvements to the Release Team have been due to orchestrating better collaboration and improved processes with other SIGs, such as SIG Docs, SIG Node, and SIG Architecture. This is visible in the Docs Freeze phase introduced with v1.30, the PRR Freeze phase that will be introduced with v1.35, and SIG Node's changes to issue triage.

## What I'll do

The Release Team is required to efficiently collaborate with all other SIGs and aspects of project leadership, giving me a birds-eye view of the difficulties different parts of the project face with respect to contributor acquisition and onboarding, contributor retention, and cross-team collaboration.

I have an excellent track record of addressing these issues within the scope of the Release Team, and intend to bring those skills to the project overall to fill gaps in processes that currently make collaborative progress more difficult than necessary. My number one goal is ensuring a Kubernetes project that is safe, efficient, and actively pleasant for our contributors and our users.
