## What I have done

I joined Kubernetes in 2020 during the fallout of the Dockershim deprecation, quelling community fears in the wake of the deprecation and ahead of the actual removal. In 2021, I joined the Release Team. Since then, the number of subteams required to release Kubernetes has been reduced from six to four while the number of KEPs has steadily increased, without increasing the workload for SIGs. Many of the improvements to the Release Team have been due to better collaboration and improved processes with SIG Docs, SIG Node, and SIG Architecture.

During the v1.28 release, I was awarded [SIG Release Contributor of the Year](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2023/#release). As v1.30 lead, I managed the merging of CI Signal and Bug Triage. I also implemented a [Docs Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#docs-freeze) phase, drastically reducing the workload for SIG Docs and Release Docs.

## What I'll do

The Release Team is required to efficiently collaborate across SIGs, giving me a high-level view of the difficulties all parts of the project face with respect to contributor acquisition and onboarding and cross-team collaboration. I intend to bring those skills to fill gaps in processes that make collaborative progress more difficult than necessary. My number one goal is ensuring a Kubernetes that is safe, efficient, and actively pleasant for our contributors and our users.
