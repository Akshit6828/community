## What I have done

I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since early 2017 (first PR in March 2018) across governance, release, and core areas—most consistently in kubeadm, SIG Node, and community programs. I’m currently a Steering Committee member and a kubeadm maintainer, and I’ve ranked among the [most active contributors over recent years](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/13/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%203%20years&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=Kubernetes&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes&var-country_name=All).

Working primarily from China, I’ve seen many new contributors in APAC struggle to get timely responses due to time-zone gaps—we faced this early on as well. I’ve helped newcomers understand processes and guided them to land contributions. I was co-chair of KubeCon China 2024 , and also supported the KCS at KubeCon China 2023 and multiple China KCDs. I spoke in KubeCon EU 2023-2025 and KubeCon China 2021-2025, and is a member of almost every KubeCon Program Committee since 2023.

Serving on Steering taught me a lot, and I’m grateful to my fellow members and everyone in the community. It’s been an honor to be part of the community, and I’m eager to keep contributing. In my new role in TAG Workloads , I can also help strengthen communication with the CNCF and better carry signals between TAG work and Kubernetes.

## What I'll do

Serving in the Steering Committee, I think we will be an important interface between the project and CNCF. I will also maintain the governance documents and help to build paths within the community, among SIGs or WGs.

Compared with my 2023 term, I’ll further leverage my TAG role to deepen Kubernetes–TAG collaboration, and—through broader participation in KubeCons across Europe and Asia—continue mentoring and advocating for APAC contributors, especially newcomers. I will approach the role with transparency, collaboration, and a strong sense of responsibility, keeping project health and the growth of new contributors at the center of my work so the community remains vibrant and sustainable over the long term.

If I can be a Steering Committee member besides TAG Workloads Chair in the following term, I will act as a direct, accountable interface between Kubernetes and CNCF—aligning roadmaps, contributor programs, and infrastructure support for long-term sustainability.
