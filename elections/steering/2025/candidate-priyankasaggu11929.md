## What I have done

I've been part of the Kubernetes project for several years now, starting with the Python-Client. 

I joined the Release Teams for v1.23–v1.31, serving as [Release-Lead—v1.29 (Mandala)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) and [Emeritus-Advisor—v1.31](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.31/release-team.md).
I also built the [automated process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1968) used by Enhancements and Bug-triage teams, since v1.27.

In SIG-ContribEx:
- I coordinated the "Meet-Our-Contributors–APAC" series ([China](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2022/08/15/meet-our-contributors-china-ep-03/), [Aus-NZ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/03/16/meet-our-contributors-au-nz-ep-02/), [India](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/10/meet-our-contributors-india-ep-01/)), which also highlighted the lack of ***Gender Diversity*** in various regions.
- One of my [direct](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7038) [contributions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7057) to the steering–committee was revamping the SIG/WG annual report templates—auto-generating list of KEPs as well as, the list of new, retired, and continuing subprojects and working-groups over the year.

In 2023, I was nominated [Technical-Lead for SIG–ContribEx](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7603) and [Kubernetes GitHub-Admin](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-contribex/c/36Y3tT06FyQ/m/WYKUHcAaDAAJ).  

I’ve also contributed to SIG-API-Machinery ([CEL-for-CRD-AdditionalPrinterColumns](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4595-cel-crd-additionalprintercolumns)) and recently, [SIG-Node](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4138#issuecomment-3220988159)-releated features.

Within broader-CNCF, I:
- co-chaired the first-ever [CNCF-Maintainer-Summit](https://youtu.be/HzuuRwvaU90?feature=shared&t=236),
- contributed to the charter-development of [WG-SPOS](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/spos/charter/#document-reviewed-and-contributed-by),
- reviewer for [CNCF-Sandbox-Projects-Annual-Reports–2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KObDX-ybKzgZ6sjpfFXNyNOmeWIoIdfd7tCtzwVNhk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3ff1v7xs75xa), under TAG-Runtime.

Other roles include [CNCF-Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/6a1b2301-ebf5-4faa-b3a7-9e306c66d504/public_url), [Election-Officer (Steering-Committee–2024)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2024#officers) and serving on several [CNCF](https://www.credly.com/badges/9f392065-a5cc-46fc-ba74-89963bb6137f/public_url) [Program](https://www.credly.com/badges/9df692db-f900-444a-b217-64f9ca1be65a/public_url) [Committees](https://www.credly.com/badges/77633770-d893-4eb1-87ff-eb74b01491ab/public_url).

On this journey, mentoring has been a source of learning, and fulfillment.  
Moreover, I've tried to preach the idea of sponsorship, which means I also ensure that I try *really* hard to vouch for and enable opportunities for folks.

I've been awarded the [CNCF-Community-Award–2024](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2024/11/14/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-the-2024-community-awards-winners/), [Kubernetes-Community-Award–2023](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2023/), and [Google-Open-Source-Peer-Bonus–Award-2023](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/12/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program-announces-second-group-of-2023-winners.html) for my work in Kubernetes.

## What I’ll do

Kubernetes has grown into a truly global project, but I believe we have more work to do.

***[Inclusion isn’t complete, until leadership is shared.](https://youtu.be/TqRM3Uxn0VU?feature=shared&t=744)***

I want to advocate for equity over equality—ensuring contributors receive what they need to succeed based on their circumstances/barriers, rather than treating everyone the same; by actively addressing/understanding regional challenges, not just acknowledging them.

I want to maintain APAC representation in the steering-committee.  
APAC has a strong foundation in non-code contributions.  
We have presence. We have leaders.  
But we still lack enough technical–leadership representation, in SIGs/WGs.

My goal is to create opportunities for APAC-contributors to grow into technical maintainers and leaders, so we've decision-makers available in our own timezones.  
This effort is also part of a larger global vision: progress here can inspire and enable other underrepresented regions to thrive too.

Ergo, we need to know where we stand on diversity.  
One of my first goals would be to discuss and push for inclusion of a metric(s) in the annual SIG/WG report that provide real insight into global representation.

We have existing processes to help SIG/WG address such gaps.  
With said data-points, I want to use those processes to provide a serious push in that direction, with an aim to improving it measurably.
