## SIGS

- SIG Release (Release Engineering Subproject Lead and Release Manager)
- SIG K8s Infra (Tech Lead)

## What I have done

I started contributing to Kubernetes in 2018 through a Google Summer of Code internship, where I worked with SIG API Machinery on improving aggregated API servers and CRDs. Shortly after, I began my journey with SIG Release. I have worked on important features and releases, mentored new Release Managers and SIG Release contributors, coordinated cross-SIG efforts, and much more. This led me to become a Release Manager and later a Subproject Lead for Release Engineering.

In the meantime, I joined SIG K8s Infra to help optimize the Kubernetes infrastructure and cloud spending. My key achievements include building a new community-owned infrastructure for hosting and serving Debian and RPM packages, as well as being part of the team that built an AWS-based CI cluster and moved many jobs to it.

I got several community awards, including a [Lift and Shift award from CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2024/11/14/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-the-2024-community-awards-winners/) and four [Kubernetes Contributor awards](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/) (2024, two in 2023, and 2022).

I've also been a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) since November 2023.

## What I'll do

Many open source projects are going through a hard time, including Kubernetes and its community. As a Steering Committee member, I would advocate for prioritizing efforts to mitigate the effects of that. The Steering Committee cannot fix technical problems, but it can support people and ensure the wellbeing of the project.

I would especially stand for more support for SIGs by providing a clear set of guidelines with a focus on attracting new and retaining existing contributors, strengthening inclusivity, and further improving and documenting the contributor ladder. Besides that, I would especially stand for resolving one of the longest standing problems — having proper recognition for all the hard work done by our community members. The Kubernetes project can only succeed with a healthy community, where everyone can join, be welcomed, and feel valued.
