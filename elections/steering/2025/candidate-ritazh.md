## What I have done

I’ve spent the last several years advancing security and policy in Kubernetes and the CNCF ecosystem. As a SIG Auth chair and a Security Response Committee member, I’ve helped shape authentication, authorization, policy, and [CVE incident-response](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3Aofficial-cve-feed%20ritazh) that balance strong safeguards with end user usability.

My technical work spans SIG Auth, SIG Node, WG Device Management, SIG Testing, SIG APIMachinery, and WG LTS. I have driven features like [DRA AdminAccess](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/5018-dra-adminaccess), [KMSv2](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/3299-kms-v2-improvements), and [Structured Authorization Configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration), and contributed numerous bug fixes and enhancements that improve reliability and security for every Kubernetes user.

I co-founded and maintain [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver) and [Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), bring secret-management and scalable policy best practices to clusters. I’ve also reviewed and contributed to **Validating Admission Policy** to make policy enforcement more reliable and portable.

I mentor contributors and unblock cross-SIG work by clarifying requirements, driving consensus, and simplifying complex issues so more people can contribute confidently.

## What I’ll do

I care deeply about the health of this project and the people who make it possible. If elected, I’ll focus on:

- **Secure-by-default:** stronger defaults and guardrails without surprising users.  
- **AI conformance:** establish standards so vendors can meet the requirements with less friction.  
- **Cross-SIG collaboration:** reduce “handoff” pain and enable incremental wins.  
- **Contributor growth:** expand mentorship and reviewer pipelines for sustainability.  
- **Project health & sustainability:** ensure the Kubernetes and subprojects are healthy, maintainers are supported, and contributors happy.  
- **Security readiness:** ensure timely fixes for security issues, deprecate unhealthy projects without security contacts, and require clear project status to reduce consumer confusion and increase maintainer accountabiliity.
