# 2024 Annual Report: WG Device Management

## Current initiatives and Project Health


1. What work did the WG do this year that should be highlighted?

The WG ramped up well after its creation, with well-attended Zoom meetings and
all-hands meetings and talks at KubeCon. The [core of Dynamic Resource
Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381) got
promoted to beta in Kubernetes 1.32.

Several new contributors have ramped up and help address open issues. [KEP
#4817](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4817) is the first
DRA feature which got defined and implemented by such a new contributor.

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with
   (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

More help with the
[example-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver) would
be welcome.
